# API Gateways/Aggregators vs. Data layers

REST API Gateways combine a set of underlying microservices that each expose a REST API into one combined API. However, these APIs are passed through as-is, which means they more often than not don't match what frontend & mobile teams need.

Data layers are a better solution because they allow frontend & mobile teams to translate those underlying APIs into what they need.
